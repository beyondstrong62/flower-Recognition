After weeks of research, coding, and fine-tuning, I'm thrilled to present a robust model that can accurately identify different flower species from images. This project was a deep dive into the world of deep learning, specifically leveraging the power of CNNs to achieve remarkable results.

Key highlights:
- Utilized a dataset containing thousands of flower images
- Implemented a CNN architecture to extract intricate features and patterns
- Achieved a high accuracy rate through extensive training and validation
- Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance model accuracy and decrease loss
